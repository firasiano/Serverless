# Serverless

# What is this?
Serverless web application, using AWS, Angularjs, and stripe for payments.
In this project, you can see how to use AWS to authenticate users logging in your web app through social websites like Google and Facebook.
Logged in users will have access to upload items on your website and specify price, description, and how long they want to have this item for sale.
Any user should be able to view these items and buy what they like.

Amazon web services used in here: IAM, DynamoDB, S3
